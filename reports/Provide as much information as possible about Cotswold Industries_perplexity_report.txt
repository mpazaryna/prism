Here are some key points about industries and economic activities in the Cotswolds:

1. **Historical Industries**:
   - **Wool Trade**: The Cotswolds became prosperous in the Middle Ages due to the wool trade, particularly with the breed of sheep known as the Cotswold Lion. This led to the construction of many large, handsome Cotswold Stone "wool churches".

The larger Cotswolds Tourism area, including Stroud, Cheltenham, Gloucester, and Tewkesbury, generated about £1 billion and provided 200,000 jobs.
   - **Agriculture**: Agriculture is important, with 86% of the land in the Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB) used for this purpose. Primary crops include barley, beans, rape seed oil, and wheat, while sheep, cows, and pigs are also reared.
   - **Real Estate and Retail**: Real estate, renting, and business activities, along with wholesale and retail trade repairs, are significant sources of income. The wholesale and retail trade was the largest employer in 2011, followed by education and health and social work.
